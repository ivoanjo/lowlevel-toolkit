:toc-title:

A Ruby gem that provides access to low-level observability APIs for Ruby applications, allowing you to track and analyze various aspects of your Ruby program's behavior.

More than the individual APIs provided, the objective of this gem is to be a repository of examples on **how to use these APIs for doing analysis**. It's expected to be a starting point when building tools.

== Quickest start

Here's a simple example of tracking GVL (Global VM Lock) usage in your application:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'lowlevel-toolkit'

def counter_loop(counter = 0) = (counter += 1 while counter < 150_000_000)

pp(LowlevelToolkit.track_wants_gvl do
  t1 = Thread.new { counter_loop }.tap { |it| it.name = 't1' }
  t2 = Thread.new { counter_loop }.tap { |it| it.name = 't2' }

  t1.join; t2.join
end.map { |thread, wants_gvl_ns| [thread, wants_gvl_ns / 1_000_000_000.0] })
----

== Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's `Gemfile` or `gems.rb` file by executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle add lowlevel-toolkit
----

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install lowlevel-toolkit
----

== Usage

Use `require "lowlevel-toolkit"` to load the gem.

The gem provides several low-level observability features:

* `track_wants_gvl`: Track when threads want to acquire the Global VM Lock
* `track_objects_created`: Monitor object creation in your application
* `last_allocation_at`: Get information about the last object allocation
* `on_gc_finish`: Set up callbacks for when garbage collection finishes
* `who_called_me`: Track the call stack of method invocations
* `release_gvl_profiler`: Profile GVL release patterns

== Examples

The gem comes with several examples in the `examples/` directory:

* `track_wants_gvl.rb`: Shows how to track GVL usage across threads
* `track_objects_created.rb`: Demonstrates object creation tracking
* `last_allocation_at.rb`: Shows how to get information about the last allocation
* `on_gc_finish.rb`: Example of setting up GC finish callbacks
* `who_called_me.rb`: Demonstrates call stack tracking
* `print_gc_timing.rb`: Shows GC timing information
* `release_gvl_profiler.rb`: Example of GVL release profiling

== Requirements

This gem requires Ruby 3.3.0 or above. Patches welcome to extend support for older Rubies :)

== Development

To use the gem locally, remember to run `bundle exec rake compile` to build the native code before you can use it. Afterwards, you can run the examples directly from the tree by running `bundle exec ruby [some example]`.

When adding new files to `ext/lowlevel_toolkit_native_extension` you need to run `bundle exec rake clean compile`. This will ensure the new files get picked up and compiled correctly.

=== Installation and deployment

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org]. To run specs, run `bundle exec rake spec`.

To run all actions (build the extension, check linting, and run specs), run `bundle exec rake`.
